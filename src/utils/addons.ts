// An add-on is a part of the admin that a congregation turns on when it wants it. Until then it
// is not in the menu and does nothing. What each add-on is called and what it adds to the menu
// is listed in pages/admin/addons.ts. This file holds only what the public website also has to
// know: which add-ons exist, and whether one is on.
//
// The choices are stored as one marked document in cms_settings (see services/addons.ts). They
// say how the admin is set up, not what the website contains, so a dataset neither holds them
// nor resets them.

// buttons are pressed. That is all. Nothing is stored in the visitor's browser, nothing about
// the visitor or the device is kept, and only sums per day are stored. (The browser's name is
// looked at where the page runs, to tell a robot from a person, and goes no further.) A visit
// is therefore one opening of the website, not one person: the same person coming back in the
// evening is a new visit, and "new and returning visitors" cannot be told apart. That would
// take remembering the browser, which the law (ekomloven § 3-15) only allows with the
// visitor's consent.
//
// One document per day holds the sums (see services/siteTraffic.ts for where it is stored).
// This file is the rules and the arithmetic: which address a count belongs to, which day and
// hour it falls on, and how the days add up to what the board shows.

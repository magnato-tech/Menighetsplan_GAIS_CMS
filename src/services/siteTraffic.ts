 *
 * The rules deployed on the live project are older than firestore.rules and reject new
 * collections (checked 7 October 2026: a read of a new collection is denied). Like the
 * volunteer roles and the headcounts, the days are therefore stored as marked documents in
 * cms_settings, which allows writes. The public website only reads the settings document
 * itself, and the listeners behind it ask for their own mark, so nobody receives the counts
 * except the board that asks for them.
 *
 * The counts are not content: a dataset neither holds them nor empties them
 * (see datasetService.ts). They are reset here, on their own.
